# Computer Scheduler

## What it does

This app was built to help with resource management issues at my job. we have many different students that sometimes come late or sometimes miss classes. There are also regularly new trial students that come in one by one. Because we want each student to have their own computer that they reuse from week to week making sure that everyone uses a computer that noone else is using can be a bit of a hastle on top of just getting the class set up for the day.

This program tries to solve this by helping identify the computers that are most available with just the press of a button. In addition it provides some surrounding infrastructure that would make taking notes and attendance easier too.

## Build instructions

This is an android studio project built with jetpack compose.

You first need to get Android Studio either from [Google's website](https://developer.android.com/studio) or the [jetbrains toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/) installer.

once you have android studio you can try and create a new project from version controll and put the url from this page into the "repository URL" option.

android studio should then work on its own to download all the dependancies and then make a build though you will need to either connect an android device or use android studio to create an emulator for the app to be run on.
